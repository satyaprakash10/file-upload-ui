File Upload & File Managing Demo link: https://www.loom.com/share/29c1b65d844b497cb486a4aaf02668d4

This is a file upload demo which is made up of vuejs and tailwind ui framework.

## Steps to be follow to run the project!

- To run the code : `npm run serve`
 
Project description:

This project is made for just demo purpose to display and to check the file managing system and its process!
the framework i.e, language which is used to build this project is : Vuejs (javasxript framework)
the UI framework which is used to design the structure overflow of this file managing demo is TailwindUI css
the component which is used to make this demo fulfilled is vuedropzone which helps to track the file managing system and to upload the files!
Note: this component requires more time to customize your own requirements based on given structure and purpose! however, the actuall use of this component i.e, vuedropzone file upload is ready to upload any file with the recommended size and validation check!


## Why I have use vue-dropzone libraries and component:-

- The vuedropzone allows us to use all the features which are covered to upload any file dynamically.
- this component libraries manage the process of file managing easily and flexibility, by simply runing the different status event and the use of its respective necessary methods on run time!
- hence this vuedropzone if fully relaible to use and to manage the file uploading process and its structure!


## Framework languge:

- The purpose and use of Vuejs is just to make project smooth and reusability of its component!
- as per javascript framework vue js is an advance language of javascript which allows us to make any project as single page application and also route based project (server side rendering!)

## UI Framework: 

-- The use of Tailwind UI css is a very easy and flexible nowadays to make any website smoothy and responsiveness with each every device thus this framework is easy and relaible to access any style by using just a single classes of style in the inline code itself without using css in style or anything!
-- hence tailwind css is the UI framework which contains whole logic of css code in just a sinlge class of one line code which could be written in a inline code without writing multiple and too much long code!
-- this will reduce the code structure a part of css in style!
